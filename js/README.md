# Specimen

_Yaml-based data-driven testing_

Specimen is a data-driven testing library as well as a yaml data format. It enforces separation between the _feature being tested_ and the _data_ used for testing.

Please find the documentation in the [main README file](https://github.com/ditrit/specimen).
